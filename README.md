# Geometry problems from ACM Timus
Solutions for some interesting geometry problems from ACM Timus

[**#1469**](https://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1469&locale=en) The problem is to determ if all the segments intersect at least 2 other segments in 2D. The solution uses Cartesian tree on segments.

[**#1285**](https://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1285&locale=en) The problem is to find out the length of the short cut from the point A to the point B not crossing the sphere with given center and radius in N-dimensional space.

[**#1477**](https://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1477&locale=en) The problem is to find the hemisphere with the largest number of given points on its surface. The solution is based on accurate full brute-force of hemispheres on each pair of points.

[**#1802**](https://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1802&locale=en) The problem is to assemble 3D cube from arbitrary cubic parts (puzzle). Simple brute-force, but it was necessary to analyze the spatial arrangement of details.

[**#1256**](https://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1256&locale=en) The task is to find the shortest path (segment or poliline depending on the situation) from a point to two circles. The solution is based on two ternary searches on circles with 1e-9 tolerance.
